# Shut the box
For those who may not know, this is a "simulator" for the game 
[shut the box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_box) in order to try to find the best strategy
not to loose the game.

The variant I'm used to play however, forces you to sum your dices dots, and to select
one or two values that also adds up to the previous sum.

This is different from what wikipedia says where you can sum or subtract the dots, and then
choose whatever available digits that adds up to your previous calculus.

# Purpose
There are actually two purposes for this little program.

First is to really take over my opponents in this game constantly !

The second, and the principle one, is to begin writing rust on a small project which took me
an afternoon. I may have to add unit tests, maybe, if I take time at some point !!!
